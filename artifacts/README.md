# artifacts

This directory contains research artifacts for the x402 product suite.

## About Artifacts

Research artifacts are intentionally context-heavy and exploratory. They exist to:

- Capture research that informs product sprint proposals
- Clarify the problem space, constraints, and opportunities
- Evaluate alternative approaches and document tradeoffs

## Artifact Template

Use **[TEMPLATE](./TEMPLATE.md)** as the starting point for new research artifacts.
