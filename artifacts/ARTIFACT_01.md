- The [x402 Hackathon Winners](https://x.com/austingriffith/status/2011108282648445294?s=20) were announced on X:
  - None of the Raid Guild projects won
  - Another open facilitator did win though
  - The winning projects had long demos

- One of the cohort members (Rome) reached out for feedback:
  > Had a good convo with Austin to get his take on our submission. Some useful insights for V2:
  > 
  > What landed:
  >
  > Once he understood the full picture, he summarized it as: “you made a facilitator that uses API keys and then you also made it forkable” ✓,
  >
  > Where we can be clearer:
  >
  > The “deploy your own facilitator” angle initially made it seem like we weren’t offering anything new (since self-hosting is already possible with x402),
  > Need to lead with the hosted facilitator + API key purchase as the core value prop, with self-hosting as a bonus,
  >
  > His suggestions:
  >
  > Reach out to people using other public facilitators and pitch them on switching to ours,
  > More customer discovery conversations,
  >
  > Solid direction for how we position V2. Lmk if you have questions.

- One of our cohort members (Patrick) proposed the following strategy:

  > i think it's a good time to start planning a discovery outreach campaign.
  > that way we have a clear direction for a proposal to RG.
  >
  > research outreaches I'm suggesting:
  >
  > - to chains to understand the current payment needs & to also understand the gap x402 payments could fill (this for the white-label facilitator).
  >
  > - to developers who would just want to use a self-hostable facilitator or facilitator API.

## Recommendations

- Conduct more product/market research and initiate more customer discovery conversations
- Clarify value proposition (lead with hosted facilitator + API key purchase with self-hosting as a bonus)
- Reach out to people using other public facilitators and pitch them on switching to our faciliator
